An emotion-based music recommendation system is an innovative approach to enhancing the user experience in the field of music streaming and discovery. Traditional music recommendation systems often rely on factors such as genre, artist similarity, or user preferences based on listening history. However, these systems may not fully capture the emotional aspect of music, which plays a crucial role in how listeners connect with and enjoy music. Emotion-based recommendation systems aim to address this limitation by incorporating emotional cues and sentiment analysis into the recommendation process.
